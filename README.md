Standard Input and Output: The Basic Engine of an Operating System

At the core of every operating system lies a simple yet powerful concept: standard input and output. These are the basic channels through which the system receives and sends data.

The operating system receives input from the keyboard (or another source) through standard input — known as stdin, which is internally identified as file descriptor 0. Functions like getc and fgets read data from this special input stream.

To send data out, the system uses standard output — called stdout, associated with file descriptor 1. Commands like puts and printf write formatted text to this output stream, which by default appears on the console.

There is also a third channel: standard error — stderr, with file descriptor 2. This is where error messages are sent using functions such as perror, keeping them separate from regular output.

By default, these three special files — stdin (0), stdout (1), and stderr (2) — are connected to the console. However, they can be redirected through pipes to other files, devices, serial consoles, or even sent across the internet. This flexibility makes them one of the fundamental building blocks of any operating system’s input/output system.

Redirection of the Three Standard Files

Every program in an operating system relies on three basic files:

Standard Input (stdin, file descriptor 0)

Standard Output (stdout, file descriptor 1)

Standard Error (stderr, file descriptor 2)


By default, these streams are connected to the console. However, an operating system can redirect them in different ways:

Redirect input or output to a file on disk or another storage drive.

Send or receive data through the network using system drivers.

Use pipes to connect the output of one program directly to the input of another.

Apply redirection through command-line options specified by the user.

Automate redirection within batch files or program macros.


This flexibility allows programs to work seamlessly not only with the console but also with files, devices, and remote systems. Redirection is one of the core mechanisms that gives operating systems their power and versatility.

Serial and Parallel Keyboards and Monitors in Early Computing

In the early days of computing, keyboards and monitors were often connected through serial or parallel interfaces. These devices could be redirected to act as replacements for the system console, allowing computers to interact with external terminals and other machines.

A computer could send its output to another computer, to a serial or parallel keyboard, or to a connected terminal. In the same way, it could also receive input from these devices. This made it possible for standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) to be redirected to a serial or parallel device instead of the local console.

This concept remains fundamental even today. Modern operating systems still support redirection of input and output — not just to local devices, but also across networks. With modern command-line tools, the same principle that once allowed communication through serial or parallel ports now enables redirection over the internet or a home network.

Batch Programs in Early Computing

In the early days of computing, when resources were very limited, one powerful solution was the use of batch programs. A batch program is simply a list of commands or tasks written in a file and executed automatically by the operating system.

This approach allowed users to:

Run multiple tasks in sequence without manual intervention.

Save time by automating repetitive operations.

Make efficient use of scarce system resources.


For many early computer systems, batch programming was a valuable resource that extended the capabilities of both users and machines. Instead of typing commands one by one, users could prepare a script in advance and let the system handle the work.

Even today, batch files and scripts remain an essential tool for automation, system management, and software development — a legacy of those first days of computing.
